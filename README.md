custom execution communication method i have created through the course of studying hyperion. they block namedpipes, although i had found a workaround, i simply quit namedpipe usage.

this **ISNT** websockets 🔌 because i just **HATE** the method and pipes are now detected 🙏

# PROBLEMS

i havent tested this yet, but if you execute the SAME script, it doesnt get modified or read by your dll/exploit
